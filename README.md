# Handwashing-and-importance

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.  With recent events, there is no question that handwashing is an essential practice, but how do we really know that it can save lives?  

Dr. Semmelweis emphasized the practice of handwashing because childbed fever, a deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth, ran rampid at the Vienna General Hospital in the early 1840s as many as 10% of the women giving birth died from it. Dr. Semmelweis knew the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!

In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Dr. Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. Let's start by looking at the data that made Dr. Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.
